## Description

This is an Epitech School project from the Advanced Mathematics 3rd year module.

Starting from the pipe’s radius (in cm) with abscissas 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 cm, and using cubic splines, this program displays the radii of N points that are evenly distributed along the pipe.

In order to simplify the debugging process, this program also display the resolved linear system’s vector result in order to obtain the spline.

## Usage

```bash
./reedpipes r0 r5 r10 r15 r20 n
```

> __r0__ radius (in cm) of pipe at the 0cm abscissa

> __r5__ radius (in cm) of pipe at the 5cm abscissa

> __r10__ radius (in cm) of pipe at the 10cm abscissa

> __r15__ radius (in cm) of pipe at the 15cm abscissa

> __r20__ radius (in cm) of pipe at the 20cm abscissa

> __n__ number of points needed to display the radius

## Need Help ?

```bash
./reedpipes -h
```
